# FFB-Draft-Assist
Project for Application Development by Samuel Newlin

The purpose of this project is to create a tool to assist in a fantasy football draft. The application will provide an interface that allows users to sort, filter, and create a draft board for their draft. The data that will be included is player names, team, position, average draft position, projected points per week, and projected points per season. The data will be fetched from the Sleeper Fantasy Football API, and stored in players_data.json.
