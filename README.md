# FFB-Draft-Assist
Project for Application Development by Samuel Newlin

The purpose of this project is to create a tool to assist in a fantasy football draft. The application will provide an interface that allows users to sort, filter, and create a draft board for their draft. The data that will be included is player names, team, position, average draft position, projected points per week, and projected points per season. Included in the software is a JSON containing the player data imported from the Sleeper Fantasy Football API. The player data will automatically import once per day to limit unnecessary traffic on the API. The cache_data.txt file stores the dates in which the application has pulled the data from the API.
